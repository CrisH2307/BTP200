I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. 
It defines a collection of related data members (attributes) and member functions (methods) that operate on those data members.

A derived class, sometimes referred to as a subclass or child class in object-oriented programming, is a class that receives attributes and behaviours
from another class known as the base class, superclass, or parent class. Here are some important distinctions between base classes and derived classes
Resources refer to dynamically allocated memory, file handles, network connections, or any other limited system or programmatic entities that need to be managed carefully
Dynamically allocated memory via new and delete, file handles gained by opening files, and network sockets are typical instances of resources.
+ Inheritance: Used to construct derived classes, allowing them to reuse the functionality and code of the base class. 
+ Code Reusability: By allowing derived classes to inherit the common properties and behaviours provided in the base class, inheritance encourages code reuse.
+ Modifying Existing Attributes and Methods: Derived classes can add new attributes and methods or alter existing ones to increase their usefulness.
+ Overriding Methods: Derived classes can override methods defined in the base class
The input and output stream objects, cin and cout, respectively, are used for input and output operations. These stream objects, 
which are a component of the common input/output library (iostream), let you communicate with users and show information on screens.
