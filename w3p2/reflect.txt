I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

In this ws3, this is the most difficult workshop that i have ever done. The main concept of this
function is basically determining the ios format and member function. Some part i didnt need to allocate memory 

ios format: It took me nearly 10 hours to understand the concept of the setf,width.
Because it was tricky when print the table header and item, especially when I setf
a direction, and I have to unsetf to prevent strange format printed in T1 and T7
The main concept of the ios format is to control the formatting of input and output data,
such as the display of numbers, alignment, precision, and other formatting options. 
It allows me to customize how data is presented when using input and output streams
Ex: 
display header function on CalorieList
cout << "+----------------------------------------------------+" << endl;
		cout << "| ";
		cout.width(FOOD_NAME + CALORIES + WHEN+ 6);
		cout.setf(ios::left);
		cout.fill(' ');

		if (isValid())
		{
			cout << " Daily Calorie Consumption";

		}
		else
		{
			cout << "Invalid Calorie Consumption list";
		}
		cout << " |" << endl;
		cout << "+--------------------------------+------+------------+" << endl;


Member function: This is more easy to understand because I have already known about data
privacy and public. When it takes the function from one header, that means that the function is
belong to the class that I declared
Ex:
int CalorieList::getTotalCalo()const
int Food::getCalo()const
